/**
 * This package contains the presentation layer components of the JavaFX application.
 * 
 * <p>The presentation layer is responsible for handling user interface concerns and
 * user interactions. It includes JavaFX controllers, views, and UI-related utilities
 * that present information to the user and interpret user commands.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key components in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>JavaFX controllers that handle user interactions</li>
 *   <li>FXML view definitions and their associated controller classes</li>
 *   <li>Custom JavaFX controls and components</li>
 *   <li>View models that adapt domain models for presentation</li>
 *   <li>UI-specific utilities and helper classes</li>
 *   <li>CSS styles and UI resources</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This package follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
 * pattern, separating UI concerns from business logic. It communicates with the
 * application layer to execute business operations and retrieve data for display.</p>
