/**
 * This package contains infrastructure components that support the application.
 * 
 * <p>The infrastructure layer provides technical capabilities to the application,
 * including configuration, persistence, external integrations, and other
 * technical concerns. It implements the interfaces defined in the domain layer
 * and provides concrete implementations for technical services.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key components in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Spring configuration classes and bean definitions</li>
 *   <li>Repository implementations for data access</li>
 *   <li>External service integrations and adapters</li>
 *   <li>Security configuration and implementation</li>
 *   <li>Technical utilities and infrastructure services</li>
 *   <li>Database configuration and migration scripts</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This package should contain all the technical details that the domain
 * and application layers should be isolated from, following the Dependency
 * Inversion Principle.</p>
